# MLOPs-Pipeline
# MLOps Pipeline Integration

This repository provides a complete MLOps pipeline that integrates with traditional CI/CD workflows. It includes automated training, validation, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models.

## Features

- Automated ML training pipeline
- Data validation using Great Expectations
- Model versioning and registry
- Automated deployment with safety checks
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Kubernetes deployment configurations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster
- AWS account (for model storage)
- MLflow tracking server
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mlops-pipeline.git
cd mlops-pipeline
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<your-mlflow-server>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret>
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

5. Deploy infrastructure:
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Repository Structure

- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipeline definitions
- `infrastructure/`: Terraform and Kubernetes configurations
- `scripts/`: Pipeline automation scripts
- `src/`: Main source code
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `configs/`: Configuration files

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes and add tests
3. Run tests locally: `make test`
4. Push changes and create a PR
5. CI pipeline will:
   - Validate code quality
   - Run tests
   - Validate data quality
   - Train and evaluate model
   - Deploy if on main branch

## Production Deployment

The pipeline automatically deploys to production when changes are merged to main:

1. Model training and validation
2. Comparison with current production model
3. Gradual rollout
4. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Monitoring

Access monitoring dashboards:
- Grafana: `http://your-domain/grafana`
- MLflow: `http://your-mlflow-server`
- Prometheus: `http://your-domain/prometheus`
